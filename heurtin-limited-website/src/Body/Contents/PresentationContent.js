<h3>Presentation</h3>
Young, dynamic and curious, I have a strong interest in programming and more specifically in 
architecture and design. I’m not afraid of hard work as long as I’m learning.
I try to always see what I’m doing from a user point of view. I like when the software/process is 
“so simple that it can’t crash”.
I see myself as someone who needs to keep learning to be able, one day, to be in charge of a whole 
project.

<h3>Career Detail</h3>

BNP Paribas – Rapid Application Developer  		 				   	  March 2017-Now
I’m currently working as a support on a front office application called Fast. Fast is mainly developed in Java and it is used by hundreds traders. It allows them to see their positions, their greeks, to book new contracts and more generally to manage their books. On a daily basis I have to fix any problem that may occur, if the problem comes from Fast, or find an easy and quick workaround if the problem comes from another application. When everything is working, I implement new features that have been asked or I improve the ones already existing.
My current position requires me to find good and stable solutions as fast as possible, but also to keep a good level of communication to secure the traders and to make the link between the FO, MO and others application fast depends on.

  SGCIB – C# Developer		 					       September 2015 – March 2017
I was working on an application of calculus of liquidity risk. We gathered data from back office then we had to provide several reports such as Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net stable funding ratio. The application, called Liqor, was in SQL but for performance and stability reasons it was decided to re-develop it in C#.
On a daily basis I had to translate SQL store procedure in testable, maintainable and fast C# code.

UL Transaction Security – C# Developer					            March 2015 – August  2015
A six month internship where I had to develop a software to help my colleagues to perform operations on chips.  The sofware, Zeus, was a GUI using Winforms. Its main purpose was to load/unload DLL and calls functions from them. It was basically a Lua IDE able to call C# functions, from Lua scripts.
